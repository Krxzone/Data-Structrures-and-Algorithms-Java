Sorting Algorithms
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

Algorithms Included
1.Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2.Selection Sort: In-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.
3.Insertion Sort: Efficient algorithm for sorting small numbers of elements. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion.
4.Merge Sort: Divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a single sorted output.
5.Quick Sort: Efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sublists according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists.
Folder Structure
Java: Contains implementations of sorting algorithms in Java.
Usage
Feel free to explore the code in each language folder. You can use these implementations as a reference, study material, or integrate them into your projects as needed.
